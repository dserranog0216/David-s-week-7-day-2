  # Min & Max Practice #1
  # Get the maximum value among the values in the following list, and store it in a variable named maximum_value:
  
  number_list = [44542247/2, 21310/5, 2134747*33, 44556475, 121676, 6654067, 353254, 123134, 55**12, 611**5]

  maximum_value = max(number_list)

  # Min & Max Practice #2
  # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum value in the following list of numbers, and store it in a variable called number_range:
  
  number_list = [44542247, 21310, 2134747, 44556475, 121676, 6654067, 353254, 123134, 552512, 611665]

  number_range = max(number_list) - min(number_list)
  print(number_range)
  
  # Min & Max Practice #3
  # Using max(), min(), and dictionary methods, get the minimum value from the following dictionary:
  
  dictionary_ages = {"Tony":55, "Paulie":42, "Meadow":78, "Vito":44, "Ralph":24, "Sarah":35, "Evan":19, "Jean":2 ,"Ned":49}

  minimum_age = min(dictionary_ages)
  print(minimum_age)
  
  # Store this value in a variable called minimum_age.
  
  # Also, get the name that comes last in alphabetical order, and store it in a variable called last_name.
